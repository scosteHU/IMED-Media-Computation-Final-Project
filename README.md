    In my game, you will be playing as an undercover character being pressured by a series of questions throw his way.
    You as the player have to make it through this series of questions with no context to the interrogators true intentions.

The user menu would display a description of what is happening, a pause feature, and a restart option

The User Input would rely on mouse clicks, the arrow keys, and the enter key.

The goal is to complete the interrogation without being seen as a guilty and to contiue on your journey

The winning conditions would be that you finish the interrogation without raising concerns, the losing conditions are that you are found guilty or worse
