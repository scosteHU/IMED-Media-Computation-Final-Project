# IMED-Media-Computation-Final-Project
    
    In my game, you will be posed with the challenge of guessing from a series of preset answers, who are Scott's 3 favorite superheroes? 

The user menu would display a description of what is happening and why it's happening.

The User Input would rely on mouse clicks and typing.

The goal is to find the correct answer among the wrong ones.

The winning conditions would be that you finish and win with the right response, the losing conditions are that you lose with one of the wrong responses.
